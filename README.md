# HTTP server written in C++
 Simple and featureless http server written in C++.
 Testing purposes only, it was not made with anything production-related in mind.
 It has a very little HTTPS request parser.

## Usage
Simply compile with 'g++ server.coo' and run
It accepts concurrent connections.
## TODO
- Refactor, code is ugly and repeats itself in places
- Add functionality (e.g. simpler routing)
